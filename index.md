Steps of using this template:

1. Write a code block with the language "bio-meta" to set up metadata.
2. Use a heading (level 1) with "#" to set the heading. Use this only once.
3. Write Markdown as usual with these extensions:
  - To add comments that are not printed, write a code block with the language "bio-remove".
  - To protect an excerpt so that it's printed as-is, write <!--[bio][protect]your content here[bio]-->.
  - To write a math equation, write `math:\LaTeX` or `display:\LaTeX`.
  - To include a list of papers, put the BibTeX citations in the order you want it to appear in a code block with the language "blog-bib".
4. Run "build.sh" or "build.bat" or "build.js" to compile.

I am an Associate Professor with the [School of Computing and Artificial Intelligence, Southwest Jiaotong University](https://scai.swjtu.edu.cn/index.html). Currently, I am working on building flexible and performance-optimized network protocols for emerging networked systems/applications like distributed machine learning. 

Prior to joining Southwest Jiaotong University, I was an engineer working on cloud storage systems at Huawei for one year. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2016. During my PhD, I also spent one year at ETH Zurich working with [Prof. Laurent Vanbever](https://vanbever.eu/). Before that, I earned my bachelor's degree in communication engineering from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2011.
